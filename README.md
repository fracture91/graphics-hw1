PoliBook program for displaying and drawing GRS files.

The program is linked against whatever files are present on the machine.
The Zoo Lab machines contain the needed library files, so they're not
included here.

To compile and run on Linux:

1. `make && ./hw1`


To compile and run on Windows (Zoo Lab machines):

1. Open "Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)" from the start menu
2. `cd C:\wherever\these\files\are`
3. `nmake /f Win-Makefile`
4. `hw1.exe`
